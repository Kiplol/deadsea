Repo for Dead Sea shmup

Basics
=======

Dead Sea is a vertically scrolling shmup in which the player controls a submarine
via touch controls.  There will be multiple levels, each with the goal of getting
to the end, defeating a boss, and collecting a piece of treasure that belonged to
an ancient princess.

Features
=======

The player can use multitouch to affect the current of the water.  The direction
in which the player swipes will determine the direction the bullets on screen
will be carried (including the player's).
